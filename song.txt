Believer. Imagine dragons

First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been,
The way that things have been,
Second things second
Don't you tell me what you think that I can be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea,
The master of my sea,

I was broken from a young age
Taken my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look to me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer.
